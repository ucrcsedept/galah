Example Usage
-------------

Here we will rename an assignment named **World Domination** to
**Local Domination**.

>>> modify_assignment 50907cca55c4481a5027103c "Local Domination"
--Logged in as jsull003@ucr.edu--
Success! The following changes were applied to Assignment [id = 50907cca55c4481a5027103c, name = World Domination].
	Name changed from 'World Domination' to 'Local Domination'.

Now we will change that same assignment back to **World Domination**, change its
due date, change what class it's for, and add a cutoff date.

>>> modify_assignment 50907cca55c4481a5027103c "World Domination Domination" "12/01/2012 23:59:59" "CS 10" "12/02/2012 23:59:59"
