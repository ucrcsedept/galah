Example Usage
-------------

Here we will create an assignment named **World Domination** due on
**October 31, 2012 at 10:09 AM** for the class **CS 9000**.

>>> create_assignment "World Domination" "10/31/2012 10:09:00" CS\ 9000
--Logged in as jsull003@ucr.edu--
Success! Assignment [id = 50907cca55c4481a5027103c, name = World Domination] created.

If we want students to not be able to submit at all after midnight of October
31, we could instead do this.

>>> create_assignment "World Domination" "10/31/2012 10:09:00" CS\ 9000 "10/31/2012 23:59:00"
--Logged in as jsull003@ucr.edu--
Success! Assignment [id = 50907db055c4481a5027103d, name = World Domination] created.
