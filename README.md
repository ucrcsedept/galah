# Galah

Galah's future is uncertain. If you'd like to support the project, please

## What is Galah?

Galah is an automated grading system geared towards processing computer
programming assignments.

Professors are responsible for creating test harnesses for their assignments.
Aside from that Galah does the rest of the work: running those tests inside of
secure Virtual Machines, consolodating results into a database, and providing an
interface for the students and teachers to see the results of the testing.

Galah aims to set itself apart from similar software suites by being
language agnostic, scalable, secure, easy to use, and simple
([more on Galah's goals](https://github.com/galah-group/galah/wiki/Goals-and-Ideals)). Check
out this
[comparison to similar software](https://github.com/galah-group/galah/wiki/Comparison-to-Similar-Software).
You can also take a look at [these screenshots](http://imgur.com/a/NG1xq) to get an idea of what using
Galah is like.

## Documentation and Getting Started

Documentation for Galah is maintained on the
[GitHub project's wiki](https://github.com/galah-group/galah/wiki). This
documentation is meant to be useful to users of Galah, interested parties
looking to see if Galah would be useful to them, and developers.

## Current Status

Version 0.1 is stable and ready to be used within a production environment. This
first version is only a submission system and does not perform any testing on
student's code.

Version 0.2 is unstable but highly useable (and is being used already). It has
support for automated grading and instant feedback. Setting it up is a
challenge though.
